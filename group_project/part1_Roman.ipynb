    "#### Target Feature:\n",
    "The target feature is of course Happiness Score which is the National average response to the question “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptive Features\n",
    "The descriptive features are as follows:\n",
    "1. **country** \n",
    "2. **year**\n",
    "3. **Social support** - The national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n",
    "4. **Healthy life expectancy at birth** - Life expectancy spent in “Good Health”. So not just Life Expectancy. Naturally Smaller than LE. \n",
    "5. **Freedom to make life choices** - The national average of responses to the question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n",
    "6. **Generosity** - The residual of regressing national average of response to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n",
    "7. **Perceptions of corruption** - The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions: (I) “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and (II) “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”\n",
    "8. **Positive affect** - The average of three positive affect measures: happiness, laugh and enjoyment. These measures are computed from responses to question such as “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”.\n",
    "9. **Negative affect** - Defined as the average of three negative affect measures. They are worry, sadness and anger, respectively. These measures are computed from responses to question such as “Did you feel sad a lot yesterday?”.\n",
    "10. **Confidence in national government** - Answer to “Do you have confidence in each of the following, or not? How about the national government?”\n",
    "11. **Democratic Quality & Delivery Quality**: both are based on Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project. The original data has six dimensions: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, GovernmentEffectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, Control of Corruption which are reduced to two here.\n",
    "12. **GDP**\n",
    "13. **Life expectancy birth**\n",
    "14. **Life expectancy age 60**\n",
    "15. **Infant mortality rate**\n",
    "16. **Neonatal mortality rate**\n",
    "17. **Under-five mortality rate**\n",

    "Data seems to be missing mostly for the years 2016 and 2017. This makes sense as these are very recent and therefore not much was published on it. However since it is under 30% for all except CPI, I replace it with the countrys average, and if that does not exist then with the worldwide average. Hover CPI will be dropped as we do not have enough data considering it only ranges back to 2012. This is unfortunate, and if one wanted to include it in the dataset one would have to focus on only 2012-2017. Replacing five years worth of data with an average seems unrealistic to me. For one or two years I imagine that the average is a good approximation but for CPI there is just too much missing"
